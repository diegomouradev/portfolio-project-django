                As a Front-End Software Engineer with a background in UI design, digital marketing, 
                email marketing, and project management, Iâ€™m enthusiastic about delivering high-quality 
                products and resolving issues with both skill and poise. My hands-on experience with 
                current web technologies, heightened interpersonal skills, and scrupulous attention 
                to detail allow me to complete projects at a high standard of excellence within declared 
                deadlines. I am looking for a placement that will be supportive of my continued growth and experience.
